									<h3 style="color: #2c3e50;">Services and Developments in Space Engineering</h3>
									<p style="color: #34495e;">
										<strong>Definition, characterization, architecture, and requirements of Space
											Systems for various missions:</strong>
										Once a space mission is defined, it is necessary to know which subsystems are
										needed to carry it out, how they will be arranged within the satellite, the
										duration of the mission, the electrical energy required, the space environment
										to which it will be exposed, the accuracy needed in various sensor measurements,
										etc. The initial phase of developing a space mission, where the entire system is
										defined in a preliminary iteration based on requirements, is crucial for the
										future development of the mission.
									</p>

									<p style="color: #34495e;">
										<strong>Manufacturing of subsystems for "New Space":</strong>
										The "New Space" concept refers to a new way of undertaking space exploration and
										commercialization, driven by the private sector and characterized by agility,
										innovation, and a new vision of space as an extension of our economy and society
										where everything is possible. Generally, nano-satellites weighing up to several
										tens of kilograms are used for these activities. The manufacturing of subsystems
										for nano-satellites, such as navigation and orbit determination systems, angular
										orientation control systems (magnetometers, magnetorquers, reaction wheels,
										etc.), propulsion systems, and others, is in high demand worldwide as
										nano-satellites are increasingly used to form space missions. For reference, the
										number of nano-satellites launched in the past 10 years has increased from
										around 200 to approximately 5,000.
									</p>

									<p style="color: #34495e;">
										<strong>Programming and analysis of space missions:</strong>
										The satellite communicates with the ground station each time it passes over it.
										During this pass, the satellite receives commands to carry out the mission,
										downloads telemetry reporting on the satellite's status and the results of the
										mission, such as satellite images of Earth. Programming the mission depends on
										many factors, such as the satellite's orbit, the timing of the mission, the
										maneuvers to be performed, the preparation of the payload (the subsystem
										carrying out the mission), etc. Programming the mission to send commands and
										analyzing it requires complex algorithms located at the ground station. If it
										involves programming the mission, these algorithms dictate to the satellite what
										it must do to complete the mission. If it involves analyzing the mission, these
										algorithms explain to the user what happened, for example, satellite image
										analysis.
									</p>

									<p style="color: #34495e;">
										<strong>Algorithms and simulations for space missions:</strong>
										Designing a space mission requires algorithms and simulations for the
										feasibility study phase, the development phase, and even after launch. For
										example, a satellite simulator is essential for understanding the origins of
										failures that may occur in various satellite subsystems during the mission.
										There are also algorithms and logic that need to be developed for the onboard
										computer, such as mission initiation and completion, angular orientation
										control, etc. All these algorithms are highly complex and require expertise
										based on experience and the ability to interpret the mission's needs.
									</p>

									<p style="color: #34495e;">
										<strong>Thermal control and space environment testing:</strong>
										The space environment is characterized by three main factors that do not exist
										on Earth, which is protected by atmospheric layers: significant temperature
										fluctuations between satellite "day" and "night," vacuum or low atmospheric
										densities, and radiation (space debris or space waste, which is unpredictable,
										also exists in the space environment). Before launching a satellite, it is
										necessary to know or predict how these factors will affect it, which is achieved
										through simulations and tests performed on Earth. Depending on these tests and
										simulations, it can be determined how to best protect the satellite in space.
									</p>

									<h4 style="color: #2c3e50;">Solar Drones</h4>
									<p style="color: #34495e;">
										Fixed-wing drones are increasingly used in various daily activities: pest
										monitoring in large-scale agriculture, topography and mapping, urbanization
										monitoring and control, national park monitoring and control, etc. Currently,
										the engines powering these drones rely on fuel, which is costly, causes
										atmospheric pollution, and limits flight time. Solar energy can be utilized by
										using solar cells that convert sunlight into electrical energy to power the
										drone engines and overcome the three inherent issues of current drones.
